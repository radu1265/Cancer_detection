# Brain cancer detection

# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This project explores two deep learning approaches for classifying brain MRI scans as cancerous or healthy. It compares a classic **LeNet** model trained from scratch with a **fine-tuned ResNet-50** pretrained on ImageNet. The main focus is on data preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization to improve performance on a limited dataset.

## üß© Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preparing MRI images from a Kaggle dataset.
- Applying preprocessing and data augmentation using **MONAI** transforms.
- Building and training two CNN architectures:
  - **LeNet** ‚Äî a simple custom network for baseline performance.
  - **ResNet-50** ‚Äî fine-tuned for transfer learning.
- Evaluating both models using **ROC-AUC**, **classification reports**, and visual comparison of results.
